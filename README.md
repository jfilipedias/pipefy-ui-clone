This project is a Pipefy UI clone developed with [ReactJS](https://reactjs.org/), [Vite](https://vitejs.dev/) and [Typescript](https://www.typescriptlang.org/) to learn more about front end development. 

The main objectives of the project were to learn more about react projects structure, practice development with typescript and develop cards interactions. Were used [styled-components](https://styled-components.com/) to UI development and [React DnD](https://react-dnd.github.io/react-dnd/about) library to implements drag and drop behavior to the cards components.
